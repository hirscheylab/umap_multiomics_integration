# Unveiling Complex Biological Networks through Advanced UMAP-Driven Multi-Omics Integration

## Introduction

This repository contains all the resources and code used in our recent paper, where we introduced and evaluated the UMAP-based Multi-omics Integration (UBMI) method.   

Our paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of the UBMI method against other state-of-the-art multi-omics integration techniques. The benchmarks encompass various scenarios, including simulated datasets, TCGA cancer datasets, single-cell datasets, and DepMap multi-omics data.

The benchmarked methods are:

  * [Integrative NMF (intNMF)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IntNMF/index.html) 
  * [Joint and individual variation explained (JIVE)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/r.jive/index.html) 
  * [Multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/omicade4.html) 
  * [Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA)](https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA)
  * [Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RGCCA)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RGCCA/index.html) 
  * [tensorial Independent Component Analysis (tICA)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1455-8)
